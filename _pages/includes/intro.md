Welcome! I am Xieyang Wang (王撷阳).

I am currently a second-year Phd student in Software Engineering at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://nuaa.edu.cn/), China. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianqiu Xu](http://dbgroup.nuaa.edu.cn/jianqiu). I received my master's degree in [Software Engineering at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/), also advised by [Prof. Jianqiu Xu](http://dbgroup.nuaa.edu.cn/jianqiu), who is an excellent teacher, guiding me to the academic path.

My research interest includes Moving Objects Database, Text-to-sql, and Automatic Index Tuning. This involves designing a natural language interface for moving objects databases, while focusing on the efficiency of structured query statements through automatic index tuning.

You can find my CV here: xxx. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](xieyang@nuaa.edu.cn).
